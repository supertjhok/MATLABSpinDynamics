function [y_min,y_max,idx,distance] = euclidean(x,cb) %#codegen
%EUCLIDEAN  Calculates the minimum and maximum euclidean distance between a 
%           point and a set of other points.
%   [Y_MIN, Y_MAX, IDX, DISTANCE] = EUCLIDEAN(X,CB) computes the euclidean 
%   distance between X and every column of CB. X is an M-by-1 vector and CB 
%   is an M-by-N matrix. Y_MIN and Y_MAX are M-by-1 vectors that are equal  
%   to the columns of CB that have the minimum and the maximun distances to 
%   X, respectively. IDX is a 2-dimensional vector that contains the column 
%   indices of Y_MIN and Y_MAX in CB. DISTANCE is a 2-dimensional vector 
%   that contains the minumum and maximum distances.
